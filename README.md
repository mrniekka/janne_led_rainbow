# janne_led_rainbow
Test of Arduino based multicolored LED-tube


Brother in law asked for my help as he had issues with functions now working properly.
I.e. button is pushed, loop starts, loop halts and does not continue when additional 
pushing of button is made. Should continue to next function.
